Project Report

Student Name: Arya Mahajan
Project Title: AI for Self-Driving Car – Traffic Sign Classification using CNN

1. Introduction

Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are widely used in many real-world applications today. One of the most important applications is self-driving cars, where computers are used to understand the environment and take decisions automatically.
In this project, I studied the basics of Machine Learning, Neural Networks, and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and implemented a model to recognize traffic signs from images. Traffic sign recognition is an important part of any autonomous vehicle system.

2. Objective of the Project

The main objectives of this project are:
-To learn Python programming for AI and Machine Learning
-To understand the basics of Machine Learning and its types
-To learn how Neural Networks work
-To implement a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification
-To understand how AI can be used in self-driving car systems

3. Tools and Technologies Used

-Python
-TensorFlow / Keras
-NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib
-OpenCV and PIL
-Scikit-learn

4. What I Learned

During this project, I learned:

-Basics of Machine Learning and its types (Supervised, Unsupervised, Reinforcement)
-How Neural Networks work using weights, bias, and activation functions
-The concept of Linear Regression, loss function, and gradient descent
-How to evaluate a model using accuracy and loss
-How Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) work for image processing

5. Methodology

The project was completed using the following steps:
-Load the traffic sign image dataset
-Resize and normalize all images
-Split the dataset into training and validation sets
-Build a CNN model using Keras
-Train the model on training data
-Validate and test the model on unseen images
-Check the accuracy and performance of the model

6. Result

The trained CNN model was able to correctly classify traffic signs with high accuracy. This shows that deep learning models can be effectively used for image-based tasks in self-driving car systems.

7. Conclusion

This project helped me understand the basics of Machine Learning, Neural Networks, and CNNs and how they are used in real-world applications like self-driving cars. It also gave me practical experience in building and training deep learning models using Python.
